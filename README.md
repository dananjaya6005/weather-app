**Currently using premium mode for weather API. For some reason, if premium subscription expired, it will down to the free plan and the forecast will show for 3 days only**

## Description
 This open-source repository contains a weather app built using React Native and Expo. The app utilizes Expo's location services to track the user's current location and fetches real-time weather data for that location from a weather API. With a user-friendly interface, the app automatically adjusts its design based on day and night, providing a visually pleasing experience. In addition to displaying the current weather, the app also includes a 10-day forecast feature, allowing users to plan ahead. The repository is an excellent resource for developers interested in building weather apps or learning about React Native and Expo's capabilities.
